The DMV

 This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

# Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

I began by viewing my ./lib files and compared them next to their /spec files and attempted to predict where an error might occur. Once I ran rspec, i would then read the failures line by line to help direct me to the position of errors.


# What was hard about working with code you did not write?

It was overwhelming at first, but the longer I worked on it, the more familiar it became.

# What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly? -->

Some of the errors were similar to ones I personally commited when writing my past project and IC so that indeed helped me point them out. Practice makes perfect.
